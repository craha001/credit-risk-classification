Module 20 Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose of the Analysis
The goal for this weeks challenge was to develop a machine learning model to predict loan outcomes based on lending data. This prediction would allow the institution to separate high-risk loans and healthy loans making overall better lending decisions.
Below is a list of X variabls or Features of machine learning model:

loan_size: Size of the loan applied for.
interest_rate: Interest rate of the loan.
borrower_income: The income of the borrower.
debt_to_income: Ratio of debt to income.
num_of_accounts: Number of accounts held by the borrower.
derogatory_marks: Negative marks on the borrowerâ€™s credit report.
